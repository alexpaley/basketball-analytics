1. It should include PPS and SBT for each player and each team for every season.
2. It should store each game for each team and player and who they played
   against and whether it was home or away.
3. It should run a statistical analysis to show the max, min, 10%, 90%, median,
   mean, mode and standard deviation for both home and away games against
   different teams and in general.
4. It should also show assists, rebounds, minutes per game, and position for
   each player and team.
5. Then it should rank the players by position so you could see in order the
   best PG, SG, SF, PF, and C are
6. Then I also want it to run a statistical analysis for which teams I expect
   to win the playoffs (my prediction is the team with the higher rank wins
   each round).
7. Grab the overall W/L record for each team and then the W/L record for home
   and away games for each team. This can be taken from the expanded standings
   chart http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2013_standings.html.
   We will use this to see if our way of predicting winners is better than just
   predicting teams based off of records.
8. Also grab the PPS and SBT for each home and away game. To do this go to

   and away games and make sure you get both the stats from the team you are
   looking at as well as the stats from the other team that game (it will be in
